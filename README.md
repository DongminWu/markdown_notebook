Just a note book!

You can find my notes here, basically they are related to what have learned.

Most of articles are written by Chinese, but I am trying to using pure English for my note now.

TODO:

1. Upload the screen shot script for Mac OS X
2. Writing a script for automatically generating the catalogue
3. Re-building my personal website(blog) based on this note book
