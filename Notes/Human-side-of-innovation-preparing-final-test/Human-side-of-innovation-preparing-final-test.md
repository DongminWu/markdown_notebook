**Difference of Innovation and Creativity**

Creativity:

- Generation of novel and useful ideas 
- Absolute (”true”) novelty
- Partially an intra-individual (自我节点内的) cognitive process
  

Innovation:

- Production of creative ideas and implementation 
- Relative novelty (e.g., ideas may be adopted from otherorganizations)
- Primarily an inter-individual(人与人之间的) social process

**Measurement of creativity**

Three Components of Creativity (Amabile, 1996a)

![](./img/2017-01-25-14-48-44.png)

Componential theory: 3 main creativity facilitators (= components)
1. Domain-relevant skills (factual knowledge, skills and experience in a specificfield)2. Creativity-relevant skills (e.g., innovative cognitive style, knowledge oftechniques to produce creative ideas)3. Task motivation (intrinsic and extrinsic)

Creativity intersection: *Highest creativity when an individual is high in all three components!*




#### >>>Amabile’s model on creativity: remember the example we discussed (MIT,Amazon Kindle)

![](./img/2017-01-25-15-02-54.png)

**Positive Organizational Influence**

- Increase intrinsic motivation:
	- Freedom & autonomy
	- Give optimal challenge
	- Assign tasks to match interests

- Increase extrinsic motivation
	- Confirm competence through recognition
	- Give a clear strategic direction
	- Provide sufficient resources

- Diminish demotivational extrinsic factors
	- Do less surveillance and establish fewer rigid procedures
	- Reduce expectation of too critical evaluation
	- Give realistic deadlines

- Domain-relevant skills
	- Provide training in relevant factors 
	- Provide support for critical success factors 
	- Assign tasks to match skills


- Creativity-relevant skills
	- Encourage unconventional thinking 
	- Support alternative solutions
	- Give time to fully capture situations and problems



**Analyzing the mini case of Kindle**

Please discuss the creative process behind this development based on Amabile’s model of creativity.

> 后面也有一些经验的结论, 这些好像也和这个minicase 相关


#### >>>Brainstorming!

> TODO: 主要是说brainstorm的问题什么的

**What is Brainstorming?**

Brainstorming is a method of group problem solving


**Possible Threats**

- Production blocking  - No uninterrupted flow of thought possible  - Only one person can speak at one time  - While others’ speak, one’ own idea production is blocked or ideas are being forgotten
- Social loafing  - Participants may not work as hard as they would alone, especially if they perceive their contribution to be unidentifiable- Evaluation anxiety and conformity  - Fear that others may negatively evaluate one’s ideas  - Members may communicate traditional or similar ideas to ”fit in” and not to diverge from others- Downward norm setting  - Performance across group members often converges  - Brainstorming participants sometimes tend to match their performance to that of the least productive members)

**Better method:**

BrainWriting

- Nominal group technique (sharing and discussing ideas after independentlywriting them down) - Electronic brainstorming (individual computer stations to type in ideas, while all or a sample of all ideas are projected on the wall or shown in a separate window on the computer screen)- Diversification of the team (e.g. regarding training) and membership change (exit of old member and entry of new member)- Trained facilitators minimize some threats, e.g. ensure that only the ideas themselves and not anecdotes are communicated


BrainWarming

In brainwarming graph, the goal grows downward into refined subgoals. 

Resoureces are interacted together and grow upward. 

When the two directions connect, solutions start to emerge.

####>>>Discussion of Empirical Studies on Creativity

#####The Impact of Mood on Creativity
Positive mood facilitates creative thinking

- Daily positive mood positively predicted daily creative thought (judged by expert raters) on the same day and with a 1-2 day delay- Aggregated monthly positive mood positively predicted monthly coworker- rated creativity- Most creative incidents (86%) associated with positive emotional reactions


But there are also opposing results:

- Negative mood positive for creativity if organization recognizes and rewards creativity (George and Zhou, 2002)



#####Motivation, Bureaucracy and Creativity

Situational influences (higher-level team climate factors) may weaken or strengthen the effect of individual differences→ **Person-in-situation theory**


研究雇员motivation和组织架构的关系

- Employee motivation was studied using 3 types of goal orientations
	- **Learning orientation** (sample item: I often look for opportunities to develop new skills and knowledge)  	- **Performance prove orientation** (sample item: I’m concerned with showing that I can perform better than my co-workers)  	- **Performance avoidance orientation** (sample item: I’m concerned about taking on a task at work if my performance would reveal that I had low ability)

- 2 bureaucracy factors  	- Centralization: 
  		- How is power distributed in an organizational hierarchy? 
  		- Is there a chain of command? 
  		- Are employees encouraged to participate in decision making
  		- Sample item: The team leader uses my work group’s suggestions to make decisions that affect us  	- Formalization: 
  		- Which rules are clearly specified, which procedures standardized? 
  		- Sample item: Our work involves a great deal of paperwork and administrations


RELATIONSHIP:

- **Performance avoidance orientation** had a negative relation with creativity (consistent with the notion that this orientation disposes individuals to be less creative because of risk of failure and the possibility of appearing incompetent)

- Employees’ **performance prove orientation** was positively related to creativity when formalization was low, but not when it was high

- When centralization was low  	- **learning orientation** was positively related to creativity
  	- **performance avoidance orientation** was less negatively related to creativity   

- When formalization was low  - performance prove orientation was positively related to creativity (see next slide)   
  - performance avoidance orientation was more negatively related to creativity

RESULT:

- To get creative results, managers should seek to understand employees’ **motivational orientations in context**, so the combination of individual disposition and bureaucratic context yields the most desirable *associations with creativity*.- **Decentralization** brings out the best in learning-oriented employees and attenuates the negative of an avoid orientation on creativity. Thus, from a creativity perspective, decentralized decision making is attractive, *even when it does little for prove-oriented individuals*.- **Formalized practices are a more complex issue**. Although the creativity of prove-oriented individuals thrives in less formalized contexts, *low formalization actually brings out undesirable tendencies in avoid-oriented team members*- ”The conclusion would be that creativity is **best obtained** by (where possible) **not selecting avoid-oriented individuals **for a team, while creating a team context characterized by **high levels of decentralized decision** making and **low formalization**, to let learning-oriented and prove-oriented individuals flourish.” (p. 638)

#####When Job Dissatisfaction Leads to Creativity

What is job dissatisfaction:

- Reactions to job dissatisfaction  - Exit: Leave the company (**active**, **destructive** reaction)  - Neglect: Lower effort (**passive** reaction)  - Loyalty: Accept status quo (**passive** reaction)  - Voice: Do something about it (**active**, **constructive** reaction)



How to measure it:
- Creativity:
	- 13 item scale (such as ”Person suggest new ways to achieve goals or objectives”)
- **Job dissatisfaction**:
    - 3 item scale (such as ”In general I like working at this company”; ”In general, I like my job”)
- **Continuance commitment**:
    - 6 item scale (such as ”Right now, staying with this company is a matter of necessity as much as desire”)
- Useful feedback from coworkers:
    - 3 item scale (such as ”I find the feedback I receive from my coworkers very useful”)
- Coworker helping and support:
    - 4 item scale (such as ”We help each other out if someone falls behind in their work”)
- Perceived organizational support for creativity:
    - 4 item scale (such as ”Creativity is encouraged at this company”; ”The reward system encourages innovation”)

RESULT:

![](./img/2017-02-01-22-43-58.png)

- Implications
    - Job dissatisfaction is not necessarily undesirable for organizations
    - Managers should (of course) not try to increase job dissatisfaction, but try to create a suitable work environment that even in this unfavorable situation positive results are possible
⇒ Positive effect on worker and organization possible
-  Critique and Further Research
    - Dyadic data: Biased responses minimized
    - Cross-sectional study: Difficult to assess causality
    - What are the effects of creative behavior in response to job dissatisfaction?
    - What is the effect of individual characteristics of workers on the analyzed
hypotheses (e.g. self-esteem)?

###Teams

#### Given Situation / task: Describe how a team can be useful in such a situation: Discuss positive factors (such as complementarities, specialisation, knowledgetransfer) as well a negative effects (such as free riding, coordination effort)

> TODO:我觉得不应该就这么点吧...每个优缺点就一句话? 


DEFINITION

A team can be defined as **a social system of two or more people**, which is embedded in an organization (context), whose members **have a common identity**, and who **collaborate on a common task** (teamwork).

>这里的chance of teamwork, 侧重于TEAMWORK, 也就是"collaborate on a common task", 讨论的是在做事儿的时候的chance和risk

#####Chances of Teamwork (Based on Scholl, 2005)

- For the organization
    - **Improved coordination** due to **interdependencies**(相互依赖) in teams
    - Better decision making (process) due to integration of different perspectives
    - Easier implementation of decisions due to consideration of various interests in the decision making process
    - Improved e ciency due better coordination of specialised capabilities
    - Better customer service due to bundling of competencies in customer contact

- For the employee
    - Faster familiarisation due to information exchange with other team members
    - Self-awareness and reflections of own behavior through feedback of other team members
    - Easier learning of new skills and acquiring knowledge
    - Better identification with the company through sense of belonging to the team (within the company)
    - Satisfaction of needs for social contacts

#####Risks of Teamwork (Based on Scholl, 2005)

- For the organization
    - **Reduction of decision quality** due to **peer pressure**
    - Increased coordination effort (especially due to interdependencies in teams)
    - Increased risk of conflicts due to different personal or professional views
    - Increased resistance of a teams against (wanted) changes due to an internal ”subculture“ .

- For the employee
    - Less motivation due to diminished influence on own performance
    - Reduced performance and dedication due to ”social slack“ of (some) team members
    - Negative influence of internal conflicts on members’ feelings
    - Conformity pressure can lead to lower performance

>下面说的advantage和problem是关于TEAM这个组织形式的, 只要有这个组织形式存在, 就会产生什么问题

#####Advantages
**Complementarities:**

The task can be done faster / more effciently with more people

**Specialisation**

Each team member may concentrate on a certain task and fulfill this task better, e.g. due to learning effects

**Knowledge transfer**

Team members possess idiosyncratic knowledge, which is helpful for other team members

#####Problems

Free-Riding problem

Coordination effort

####Free-riding

What Influences the Decision to Free-ride?

- Team size
- Relations within the team     
- Observability of effort
- Punishments
- Norms

**Team Size:** 
    
The larger a team, the smaller the individuals’s impact on the outcome

Plus, it is harder to observe individual effort of each member  

CONCLUSION The larger the team, the higher the incentives to free-ride

**Team composition:**    
    
- Team composition is thus facing the following problems:
    - How many members should a team have?
    - Who should be part of the team?
    - Is free-riding punished? Are there any individual incentives?
    - What kind of working norm is there in the team / the organization?

If the team is composed of very heterogeneous(各种各样的) members with heterogeneous tasks, it is more diffcult to observe and judge individual effortCONCLUSION The more homogeneous a team, the lower the incentives to free ride

####Design of Incentives for Teams

*Explicit Incentives*

- Team bonus (e.g. Bonus for completion of an R&D project in time)
    - Problem: Only if the bonus is based on individual effort it counters the free-riding problem
    - This, however, requires observability of the individual effort
- Profit sharing (variable part of the salary depends on company profit)
    - Huge free riding problem (Large group, low observability, little influence)
- Stocks and stock options
    - Basically the same effect (and problems) as profit sharing (only a different
success measurement)

*Implicit Incentives: Norms*

In order to **improve the team coordination and spirit**, the company / team leaders max try to establish team norms

Such norms **generate behaviour expectations** against other team members and thus have (implicit) effect on team behaviour and activities

Norms can concern and **affect all kinds of behaviour** in R&D teams, such as performance norms, communication norms, cooperation norms

Considering the previous formal analysis: If there are established team norms, **deviation from the norm causes ”costs“** for the deviating team member

>偏离了团队价值观!就是和其他人不能友好相处


*Problems with Norms*

>建设团队价值观, 准则的时候,会遇到的问题



- Search for suitable norms (What kind of norms are right for this particular team, suitable for the organization culture?)
- Norm establishment (Exemplifying norms by higher management, honoring of members who work accordingly)
- Norm control (Supervision, sanctioning: Suitable in an R&D team (?)).
- Adaptation of norms (Reaction to new conditions, new team members, new
tasks).

>但是这些问题都不会很危险, 因为:

*Why is it not that Critical?*

- Intrinsic motivation (People in R&D often actually like doing their job) - Other benefits (Working in the team leads to personal benefits)
- Commitment to the team (Feeling of a community)
- Reciprocity (Hope that others will engage as well)
- Trusted partnership with employer
- Teamwork is perceived as a good thing – and should therefore be supported

####Idea Generation, Creativity and Incentives (Toubia, 2006)RESULTThe paper shows that different incentive schemes may trigger different behaviour

- It appears that extrinsic incentives are **not detrimental to creativity** (contrary to some psychological literature)
- **Impact based incentives** trigger exploration 
- Incentives need to **fit to the type** of task>实验让大家提点子,然后用三种不同的奖励方式来奖励
>
>(1) Flat condition: Participants received a flat reward of $10>
>(2) Own condition: Participants rewarded based exclusively on their own contribution ($3 for each new original idea submitted)>
>(3) Impact condition: Participants rewarded based on the impact of their ideas: ($2for each new idea that builds on one’s own idea)
>
>上面提到的 **Impact based incentives** 就是基于影响力的激励



####Teamwork and success (hackman model): Similar question as above (Amabile) possible

>这个model是用来衡量一个team是不是有效率, 这个team的表现怎么样的工具

It provides a **diagnostic tool** to assess and design work environments for work groups in organizations

![](./img/2017-01-27-02-13-00.png)



three process criteria of effectiveness 

- Effort applied to the group task
- Amount of knowledge and skill applied to the group task 
- Task-appropriate performance strategies

Each of these criteria is influenced by the **organizational context** and the **group design**, with **group synergy** as a moderator(调节器)



>这里的逻辑是这样的: 
>
>一个team的效率首先分成两部分来评估:
>
>1. Process Criteria of Effectiveness((衡量teamwork)效率的过程标准?): 
>2. Material Ressources (物质资源)
>
>其中Process Criteria of Effectiveness又再分成三个小部分评估
>
>1. Organizational Context
>2. Group Design
>3. Group Synergy
>
>评估的话总要有个标准吧, 于是这个Hackman提出了对着三个小部分评估的标准
>
>1. Effort applied to the group task
>2. Amount of knowledge and skill applied to the group task 
>3. Task-appropriate performance strategies
>
>下面就介绍了具体到每个标准, 在每个小部分里面是怎么评估的


**Effort applied to the Group Task**

- Group design: Structure of the task:
    - If the task requires a variety of **high-level skills** and has a **visible outcome**,
    - If this outcome has **consequences for other people**(对他人有意义), and the group is clearly
responsible for this outcome
    - If regular performance **feedback** is given --> Work will be perceived as meaningful leading to higher effort(如果工作被别人察觉到是有意义的, 那么就会更加努力工作) (这一点和下面的reward是不是重复了?)
- Organizational context: Reward system
    - Set **challenging**, **specific** performance objectives
    - Provide positive consequences for **excellent** performance
    - Focus on **group rewards** and objectives (not individual behaviour)
- Group synergy
    - Minimize coordination and motivation losses (e.g. through free-riding problem,
see above)
    - Create **shared commitment** 创造共有的义务


**Amount of knowledge and skill applied to the group task**

- Group design: Composition of the group
    - Individuals should have high task-relevant expertise
    - The group size should be large enough to do the work (but not too large) 
    - Members should have interpersonal skills (in addition to task expertise) 
    - Heterogeneity is moderately diverse
- Organizational context: Education system
    - The organization helps the team to obtain ”outside” experience to get along
with its work, such as educational resources (e.g. seminars)
- Group synergy
    - Minimize inappropriate weighting of member contributions (based on
task-irrelevant considerations such as demographic attributes, race, gender,
etc., or behavioral style)
    - Foster collective learning to increases the total pool of talent available for
task work

**Task-Appropriate Performance Strategies**

- Group design: Group norms (see above)
    - Norms should be clear and intense
    - Norms should support situation scanning and strategy planning (in order to
be adaptable)
- Organizational context: Information system
    - Clarity about the parameters of the performance situation (task requirements,
available material resources, people who receive/ review the group ”product”) 
    - Access to data about likely consequences of alternative strategies (analytic
tools to compare and evaluate probable consequences)
- Group synergy
    - Minimize slippage in strategy implementation 
    - Create innovative strategic plans


**Group Effectiveness**

- The productive output of the team should **meet or exceed the performance
standards** of the ”clients” / people (e.g. managers, executives) who receive
and / or review the output
- The social processes used in carrying out the work should **maintain or enhance
the capability of team members** to work together on subsequent team tasks 
- The group experience should, on balance, **satisfy rather than frustrate the
personal needs** of team members


**material resources** (Suffciency of material resources required to accomplish the task well and on time) is then a moderator of the influence of the process criteria of effectiveness on group effectiveness


#####Teamwork Quality and Success

>这个TWQ主要衡量的是team里面合作的程度是好是坏

TWQ: teamwork quality, TWQ is a comprehensive(全面的) measure of the quality of cooperations in teams

- Communication
    - Team members communicate frequently, directly and personally,
spontaneously
    - Information is shared openly by all team members, on time, precisely and
useful
- Coordination
    - The subtasks within the project are closely harmonized
    - Goals for subtasks are clear, fully comprehended and accepted by all team
members
- Balance of Member Contributions
    - Individual potential is recognized and members contribute in accordance to
their potential
    - Conflicts due to imbalance of contributions should be avoided
- Mutual Support
    - Team members help and support each other as the best they could   - Conflicts are easily and quickly resolved
    - Discussions and controversies are conducted constructively.
    - Suggestions and contributions are respected by all team members.
Suggestions are discussed and further developed.
    - The team is able to reach consensus regarding important issues.
- Effort
    - Every team member fully pushes the project.
    - Team members make the project their highest priority.
    - The team puts much e↵ort into the project.
    - There are no conflicts regarding the e↵orts that team member put into the
project.
- Cohesion
    - The team members are strongly attached to the project.
    - It is important for the team members to be part of the team. Members feel
proud to be in the team.
    - All team members are fully integrated in the team.
    - There is personal attraction between the team members.
